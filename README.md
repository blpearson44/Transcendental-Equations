# Transcendental Equations
When a variable appears multiple times as an argument in a transcendental equation, it cannot be solved easily.
Generally this will require a numerical solution.

## Numerical Solutions
We have two numerical methods we will use to solve this.

### Functional Iteration
With functional iteration, we take a guess at the value for x and plug it in to find the next value of x. Repeat until the answer converges.

### Newton's Method
With Newton's method, we find the function's derivative and subtract f/df from our guess and then plugging in the next value repeatedly.
